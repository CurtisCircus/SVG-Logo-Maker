## Installation
The only installations needed would be inquirer 8.2.4 and mxlbuilder which the user can install by entering "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" for inquirer and "npm i mxlbuilder" for mxlbuilder into their integrated terminal.

## Usage
To use the code, the user will need to enter "node index.js" into their integrated terminal and answer the questions prompted. The only thing that might throw users for a loop is that they'll need a hex code and when they enter it they will need to include # at the beginning of it.

## Contributing
Anyone can use this code for their own personal projects, I don't plan on changing what I have so anyone can offer to make a merge or push request but it more than likely will be rejected.
